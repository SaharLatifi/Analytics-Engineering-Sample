## ðŸš€ Current Progress: Learning dbt

**Project Status:** ðŸ“˜ Learning Phase

### Focus Areas in dbt:

- [ ] Understanding dbt Core Concepts
- [ ] Learning dbt Models and Transformations
- [ ] Experimenting with dbt Sources and Seeds
- [ ] Practicing with dbt Tests and Documentation
- [ ] Building a Sample dbt Project

_I am currently in the process of learning dbt (Data Build Tool), an open-source transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform, test, and document data in the warehouse. This README will be updated as I progress through my learning journey._

## About This Project

This project is a part of my journey to learn dbt. Here, I'll be documenting my progress, challenges, and insights gained throughout the learning process. The aim is to apply dbt concepts in practical scenarios and build a solid foundation in data transformation and modeling.
